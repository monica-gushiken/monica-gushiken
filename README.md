### Hi there 👋

My name is Monica Mayumi Gushiken. I'm a brazilian girl (🇧🇷). I'm currently interested on learning about mobile development (especially Flutter) and Automated Testing. 

In my free time I like to make amigurumi - a Japanese word which describes small knitted or crocheted stuffed toys (👵), to watch series (📺), to study (📚), to listen and play some music (🎵🎸) and to stay with family and friends (❤️).

Would you like to find me?
